# WebCrawling-SaikaiScan
- Author: Anthony Tesche

## Description
- I made this code for studying python and how a Web Scraping/Crawling works.

## How to use
- Find the var "my_url" and change for the url of your first chapter novel
- Change for the amount of chapters your novel have "for url in range(x)"
- In case you try to use in another site change this line "my_url = 'https://saikaiscan.com.br' + url"

## Observations
- Use with Python ^3
- If encounter this error "ImportError: No module named bs4 in Windows" use the ""pip install BeautifulSoup4"".
